# 1. Description
* I made 2 games when I was trying to learn clearer Python.
* So the first game is Shooting Alien, this game is so simple. You could go to the directory `alien_invasion` and run file `main.py` to run the game.
* The second game is Pacman game. So you do not need to play this game, because the pacman guy plays game automatically. Your main task will just to find a seat and watch the pacman plays the game ðŸ˜….

# 2. Installation
* Create a new conda environment and then activate it with these commands:
  ```bash
  conda create --name pygame python==3.8.10 pip
  conda activate pygame
  ```

* Install some package in file `requirements.txt`.
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Done ðŸ˜¤.
